This is the highest-value feature because it directly answers the question every developer and AI agent asks: 'What can I actually work on right now?'\n\n## Background \u0026 Motivation\nThe analysis package already computes TopologicalOrder via topo.Sort(). However, this raw ordering isn't directly actionable because:\n1. It includes closed issues\n2. It doesn't filter to 'leaf nodes' (tasks with no open blockers)\n3. It's not exposed via CLI for programmatic access\n\n## Value Proposition\n- For Humans: A 'Smart To-Do' view showing only actionable items eliminates cognitive overhead of scanning blocked tasks.\n- For AI Agents: --robot-plan enables autonomous workflows where agents can request a strictly ordered task list, preventing work on blocked items.\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Add GetActionableIssues() to analysis package - returns issues where all blocking dependencies are closed\n2. Add GetExecutionPlan() - returns topologically sorted actionable items with parallel tracks identified\n3. CLI flag --robot-plan outputs JSON with execution order\n4.
