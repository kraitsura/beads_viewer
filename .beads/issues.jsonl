Add git history loader (read files at specific commit)\n2. Create snapshot comparison logic\n3. Generate diff report (new/closed issues, metric changes, new cycles)\n4. CLI: --diff-since \u003ccommit|date\u003e and --as-of \u003ccommit|date\u003e\n5.

Labels naturally encode intent (e.g., \"Phase1\", \"frontend/ui\", \"feat:inbound-emails\"), but there's no way to operationalize that grouping as a working context.\n\n## Solution\nThe Labels Viewer uses labels as a \"net\" that captures primary issues, automatically expanding to show all connected dependencies for comprehensive visibility.

Users want to search by meaning, not just keywords. AI agents benefit from semantic retrieval for RAG patterns.\n\n## Value Proposition\n- For Humans: 'that thing about memory leaks' actually finds it\n- For AI Agents: RAG over project history - 'how did we solve similar issues before?'\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Local embeddings (start simple: sentence-transformers via subprocess or pure Go)\n2. Vector storage (sqlite-vec extension or simple flat file)\n3. Incremental indexing (embed on first access, update when issues change)\n4. Semantic search mode in CLI and TUI\n\n## Scope Control\nStart minimal:\n- Embed title + description only\n- Single embedding model\n- Top-10 results\n- No hybrid search initially\n\n## Dependencies \u0026 Risks\n- Embedding model choice affects quality and size\n- May require external tool (Python) initially\n- Could start with Go-native solution later","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-11-26T23:37:01.591735409Z","updated_at":"2025-11-26T23:37:01.591735409Z","labels":["ai-agent","search","semantic"]}
